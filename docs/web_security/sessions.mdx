## In the begining
Let us create a php file for starting the session
```php
<?php
  session_start();
?>
```
`session_start()` creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed 
via a GET or POST request, or passed via a cookie.

Once we open the file in the browser, we will see that a cookie named `PHPSESSID` is created

A session file is created in our server in the /tmp directory
```bash
# ls /tmp 
sess_ca9f1b3ed05ab874e5d47ab522867ee3
```
## Capture traffic in Burpsuite

The first time we visit the webpage, raw request is given below
```
GET /sess.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.105:5000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```
When we visit the webpage again, we see that `PHPSESSID` cookie also travels along with the 
request

```
GET /sess.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.105:5000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: PHPSESSID=ca9f1b3ed05ab874e5d47ab522867ee3

```
## Play with Sessions
Let us set a few session variables, these are set with the PHP global variable $_SESSION.
These variables can be accessed during lifetime of a session.

```php
<?php
  session_start();
  if (isset($_SESSION['user'])) {
    echo "Welcome :". $_SESSION['user']."<br>";
  }
  else {
    $_SESSION['user'] = "burp";
  }
?>
```
Now, when the user visits the webpage, an entry is made inside the sessions file in the server
```
$ cat sess_ca9f1b3ed05ab874e5d47ab522867ee3 
user|s:4:"burp";
```
The second and subsequent times, the user visits the webpage, "Welcome :burp" is displayed on the browser.
